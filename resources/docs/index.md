# Introduction

The hopn.space API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Our technical support is available by email at support@hopn.space and by phone at +33 9 72 28 11 76 from Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

<aside>As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages in the dark area to the right (or as part of the content on mobile), and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right (or from the nav menu at the top left on mobile).</aside>
